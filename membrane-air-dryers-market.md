<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Air Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous</li><li>Non-Porous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membrane air dryers are essential for removing moisture from compressed air systems and are categorized into two main types: porous and non-porous. Porous membrane dryers utilize a semi-permeable membrane that allows moisture to pass through while blocking air, effectively separating water vapor from the gas stream. Non-porous membrane dryers, on the other hand, rely on selective diffusion principles, where water vapor diffuses through a non-permeable barrier, maintaining the integrity of the compressed air while removing contaminants. Together, they cater to diverse industrial applications.</p></p>
