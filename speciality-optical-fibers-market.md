<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Speciality Optical Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fiber</li><li>Single-mode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The specialty optical fibers market encompasses two main types: multimode fiber and single-mode fiber. Multimode fiber features a larger core diameter, allowing multiple light modes to propagate simultaneously, making it ideal for short-distance data transmission, such as within buildings. In contrast, single-mode fiber has a smaller core, enabling only one light mode to travel, thereby supporting longer distances with higher bandwidth and less signal loss. Both types are crucial in various applications, including telecommunications, data centers, and industrial uses.</p></p>
