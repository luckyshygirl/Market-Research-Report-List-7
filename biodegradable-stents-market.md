<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biodegradable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer Based Bioabsorbable Stents</li><li>Metal Based Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biodegradable stents market is primarily divided into two types: polymer-based bioabsorbable stents and metal-based bioabsorbable stents. Polymer-based stents are constructed from bioresorbable polymers designed to degrade naturally over time, providing temporary support to blood vessels while minimizing long-term complications. In contrast, metal-based bioabsorbable stents utilize absorbable metals that dissolve within the body after serving their purpose, offering mechanical strength during critical healing periods. Both types aim to enhance vascular healing and reduce risks associated with permanent implants.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Biodegradable Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coronary Artery Disease</li><li>Peripheral Artery Disease</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biodegradable stents market is primarily driven by their application in treating coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). In CAD, these stents serve to support narrowed or blocked arteries, promoting better blood flow while gradually dissolving to minimize long-term complications. Similarly, in PAD, biodegradable stents improve circulation by maintaining open arteries in the limbs. Their innovative design reduces the risk of restenosis and long-term metal exposure, making them a preferred choice for cardiovascular interventions.</p></p>
